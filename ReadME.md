# ConsoleCord

The console-based Discord Client (for absolute hardcores)

# Disclaimer

ConsoleCord is considered a self bot as it uses a user token to make modified requests via the Discord API. Although it is very unlikely you will be caught (since all the requests structured as regular user requests), please know that I am NOT responsible for any action Discord takes on you're account. Use this tool wisely
